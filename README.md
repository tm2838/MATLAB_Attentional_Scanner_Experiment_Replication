# Attentional Scanner Experiment Replication

This project reproduces a Generalized	Posner Paradigm to examine the speed of attentional Scanner.

In valid trials, the presentation of the cue indicates the upcoming presentation of the target in the exact same spot, while in invalid trials, the presentation of the cue no longer has the informative role, so the target will appear in a different location.

Reaction time in valid and invalid trials will be recorded and compared.

SampleData.mat contains 1280 sample trials.
